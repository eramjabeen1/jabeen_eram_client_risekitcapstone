RiseKit (Frontend)

This README was temporarily overwritten during a Git merge conflict while restoring backend changes. The correct frontend documentation will be re-added after final polish.

Frontend status:

Full CRUD working (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

Toggle between test mode and authenticated user mode

Clean UI with journal entry blur and private toggle

Update and delete entry support confirmed

A final README with screenshots, setup instructions, and project overview will be added again in a bit.
